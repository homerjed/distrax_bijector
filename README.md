# distrax_bijector

A normalizing flow of rational quadratic spline bijectors that transforms conditioned on a context variable.

Figure shows two plots of the training distribution (each left) and the base distribution (upper right) and the learned transform distribution. Need to put these scripts together...

Use:
```python main.py```
